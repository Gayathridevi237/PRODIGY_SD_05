Web Scraper

This project is a simple web scraping script designed to collect product information from eBay search result pages. The script uses Python's requests,
BeautifulSoup, and pandas libraries to extract product names, prices, and ratings and save them into a CSV file for further analysis.



Code Structure

Here's an overview of how the script is organized:

python

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import time
import random

  Libraries: The script imports essential libraries: requests for handling HTTP requests, BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content,
   pandas for CSV operations, time for handling delays between requests, and random for generating random delays to mimic human 




Improvements and Considerations


Possible Enhancements

   Dynamic URL Generation: Implement a function to dynamically generate URLs based on user input for different search terms.
    Advanced Error Handling: Improve error handling with specific exceptions and retries on failed requests.
    Proxy Support: Integrate proxy support to manage multiple IP addresses and avoid potential IP bans.
    Data Enrichment: Extract additional product details like shipping costs, availability, or seller information.
    Data Cleaning: Include additional data cleaning steps, such as removing duplicates or filtering based on criteria like price range or rating threshold.

Performance Considerations


   Request Frequency: Keep delays between requests to a reasonable length to prevent overloading eBay's servers.
    Data Limits: Be aware of eBay's data usage policies and limit the number of requests accordingly.
